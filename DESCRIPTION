Title: Analyze high-throughput sequencing of T and B cell receptors
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: 
    person("First", "Last", , "first.last@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This R package analyzes high-throughput sequencing of T
        and B cell receptor complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3)
        sequences generated by Adaptive Biotechnologies' ImmunoSEQ
        assay.  Its input comes from tab-separated value (.tsv) files
        exported from the ImmunoSEQ analyzer.
Depends: R (>= 4.1.0), data.table
