#' Clonality (summary statistics)
#'
#' `clonality()` Creates a tibble giving the total number of sequences, number
#' of unique productive sequences, number of genomes, entropy, clonality, Gini
#' coefficient, TCR/BCR convergence, and the frequency of the top productive 
#' sequences for any given sample.
#'
#' @param study_table A tibble consisting of antigen receptor sequencing
#' imported by the LymphoSeq2 function [readImmunoSeq()]. "junction_aa",
#' "duplicate_count", and "duplicate_frequency" are required columns. Note that
#' clonality is usually calculated from productive junction sequences.
#' Therefore, it is not recommended to run this function using a productive
#' sequence list aggregated by amino acids.
#' @param rarefy A Boolean value
#'    * `TRUE` : Rarefied diversity metrics are calculated by sampling down each
#'    repertoire in the input table down to the repertoire with the smallest 
#'    number of sequences and calculating the diversity metrics on the sampled
#'    data. The process is repeated for the number of iterations specified by 
#'    the user and the diversity metrics are averaged over the number of 
#'    iterations. Default 100 (the default)
#'    * `FALSE` (the default): Diversity metrics will be calculated considering 
#'    the raw repertoire data for each of the samples 
#' @param iterations Number of iterations to run the sampled clonality metrics.
#' @param min_count The minimum depth to which each repertoire in the study must
#' be sampled to. Default 1000 (the default)
#' @return Returns a tibble giving the total number of sequences, number of
#' unique productive sequences, number of genomes, clonality, Gini coefficient,
#' Simpson index, inverse Simpson index, and the frequency of the top
#' productive sequence for each repertoire_id.
#' @details Clonality is derived from the Shannon entropy, which is calculated
#' from the frequencies of all productive sequences divided by the logarithm of
#' the total number of unique productive sequences.  This normalized entropy
#' value is then inverted (1 - normalized entropy) to produce the clonality
#' metric.
#'
#' The Gini coefficient is an alternative metric used to calculate repertoire
#' diversity and is derived from the Lorenz curve.  The Lorenz curve is drawn
#' such that x-axis represents the cumulative percentage of unique sequences and
#' the y-axis represents the cumulative percentage of reads.  A line passing
#' through the origin with a slope of 1 reflects equal frequencies of all clones.
#' The Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area between the line of equality
#' and the observed Lorenz curve over the total area under the line of equality.
#' Both Gini coefficient and clonality are reported on a scale from 0 to 1 where
#' 0 indicates all sequences have the same frequency and 1 indicates the
#' repertoire is dominated by a single sequence.
#'
#' TCR/BCR convergence is defined as the average number of productive CDR3
#' nucleotide sequences that form the same productive CDR3 amino acid sequence.
#'
#' Sequencing depth and amount of input available can often confound diversity
#' metrics. For example, a peripheral blood sample can appear to be more clonal
#' than a tumor sample when it is not sequenced to adequate depth. To overcome
#' this we can sample down the sample down all repertoires to the depth of the
#' sample with the least number of sequences and then calculate the diversity
#' metrics. Repeating this process multiple times and averaging the diversity
#' metrics can give a more accurate representation of sample diversity and
#' enable comparison of repertoire samples from different experiments and
#' different tissue of origin
