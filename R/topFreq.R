#' Top frequencies
#'
#' Creates a table of the top productive amino acid sequences that have a
#' specified minimum frequency threshold and reports the number of samples that
#' the sequence appears in along with the minimum, maximum, and mean frequency
#' across all samples.  For T cell receptor beta sequences, the percent prevalence
#' and antigen specificity of that sequence is also provided.
#'
#' @param productive_table A tibble of productive amino acid sequences
#' imported using the function LymphoSeq2 function [productiveSeq()] where the
#' aggregate parameter was set to "junction_aa".
#' @param frequency The minimum frequency that the sequence appears in any of
#' the listed samples.
#' @return A tibble of amino acid sequences and the number of samples that
#' the sequence appears in along with the minimum, maximum, and mean frequency
#' across all samples.
#' @details For T cell receptor beta sequences, additionally reported is the
#' \% prevalence that the sequence appears in 55 healthy donor blood samples.
#' Also provided is the antigen specificity of that sequence if known by
#' comparing it to a database of previously reported sequences in the
#' literature.
