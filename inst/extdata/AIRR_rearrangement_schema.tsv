Name	Type	Attributes	Definition
sequence_id	string	required, identifier, nullable	"Unique query sequence identifier for the Rearrangement. Most often this will be the input sequence header or a substring thereof, but may also be a custom identifier defined by the tool in cases where query sequences have been combined in some fashion prior to alignment. When downloaded from an AIRR Data Commons repository, this will usually be a universally unique record locator for linking with other objects in the AIRR Data Model.
"
sequence	string	required, nullable	"The query nucleotide sequence. Usually, this is the unmodified input sequence, which may be reverse complemented if necessary.
