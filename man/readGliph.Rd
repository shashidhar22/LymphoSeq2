\title{Read GLIPH files}
\usage{
readGliph(gliph_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{gliph_path}{Path containing GLIPH convergence group files. The file
name will be used as repertoire_id in the output, it is advisable to rename
the GLIPH2 files to match input TRB file names so that the GLIPH2 table and
repertoire table can be merged}
}
\value{
Tibble with four columns, repertoire_id, gliph count, specificity
group and junction amino acid sequence. The GLIPH file name is used as the
repertoire_id
}
\description{
\code{\link[=readGliph]{readGliph()}} Imports tab-separated value (.tsv) files generated by GLIPH
}
\details{
The files contain three columns, the GLIPH2 convergence group count,
The specificity group sequence and a space separated list of junction_aa
sequences. The function reads these files into a tibble with three columns,
expanding the junction_aa column such that each row in the tibble corresponds
to one junction_aa
}
\examples{
file_path <- base::system.file("extdata", "TCRB_gliph", package = "LymphoSeq2")
gliph_table <- LymphoSeq2::readGliph(file_path) 
}
