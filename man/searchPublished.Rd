\title{Search for T cell receptor beta CDR3 amino acid sequences with known antigen
specificity}
\usage{
searchPublished(study_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_table}{A tibble generated by the LymphoSeq2 functions
\code{\link[=readImmunoSeq]{readImmunoSeq()}} or \code{\link[=productiveSeq]{productiveSeq()}}.  "junction_aa",
"duplicate_frequency", and "duplicate_count" are required columns.}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble with each instance that a published TCR sequence
appeared along with additional information including antigen specificity,
epitope, HLA type, and PubMed ID (PMID) for the reference where the sequence
was characterized.
}
\description{
Search for published T cell receptor beta CDR3 amino acid sequences with
known antigen specificity in a list of data frames.
