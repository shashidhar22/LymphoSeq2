\title{Search for a sequence}
\usage{
searchSeq(
  study_table,
  sequence,
  seq_type = "junction",
  edit_distance = 0,
  match = "global"
)

findSeq(sequence, query_list, edit_distance, seq_type, match)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_table}{A tibble generated by the LymphoSeq2 functions
\code{\link[=readImmunoSeq]{readImmunoSeq()}} or \code{\link[=productiveSeq]{productiveSeq()}}.  "junction_aa" or "junction",
"duplicate_frequency", and "duplicate_count" are required columns.}

\item{sequence}{A character vector of one ore more amino acid or junction
CDR3 sequences to search.}

\item{seq_type}{A character vector specifying the type of sequences to be
searched.  Available options are "junction_aa" or "junction".}

\item{edit_distance}{An integer giving the minimum edit distance that the
sequence must be less than or equal to.  See details below.}

\item{match}{A string indicating the type of sequence matching to perform.
Acceptable values are \code{"global"} and \code{"partial"}. See details below.}

\item{query_list}{List of productive CDR3 nucleotide or amino acid sequences}
}
\value{
Returns the rows for every instance in the list of data frames where
the searched sequence(s) appeared.

Tibble of sequences that differ from the input sequence by the edit distance
threshold provided
}
\description{
Search for one or more amino acid or junction CDR3 sequences in a study tibble.
}
\details{
An exact partial match means the searched sequence is contained
within target sequence.  An exact global match means the searched sequence is
identical to the target sequence.

Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two sequences
are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to
transform one sequence into the other.  For example, an edit distance of 0
means the sequences are identical and an edit distance of 1 indicates that
the sequences different by a single amino acid or junction.
