\title{Top frequencies}
\usage{
topFreq(productive_table, frequency = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{productive_table}{A tibble of productive amino acid sequences
imported using the function LymphoSeq2 function \code{\link[=productiveSeq]{productiveSeq()}} where the
aggregate parameter was set to "junction_aa".}

\item{frequency}{The minimum frequency that the sequence appears in any of
the listed samples.}
}
\value{
A tibble of amino acid sequences and the number of samples that
the sequence appears in along with the minimum, maximum, and mean frequency
across all samples.
}
\description{
Creates a table of the top productive amino acid sequences that have a
specified minimum frequency threshold and reports the number of samples that
the sequence appears in along with the minimum, maximum, and mean frequency
across all samples.  For T cell receptor beta sequences, the percent
prevalence and antigen specificity of that sequence is also provided.
}
\details{
For T cell receptor beta sequences, additionally reported is the
\\% prevalence that the sequence appears in 55 healthy donor blood samples.
Also provided is the antigen specificity of that sequence if known by
comparing it to a database of previously reported sequences in the
literature.
